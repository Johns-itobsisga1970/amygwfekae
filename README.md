I just stumbled out of the theater after watching Thudarum, and I'm honestly not sure if my brain is still in my skull or if it just decided to stay back there, soaking up the melodramatic vibe cloud. Seriously—what a trip that was. You know how you sometimes go into a movie with zero expectations, like, maybe the trailers either mumble at you or yell too loudly, but you’re just there? Yeah, that was me. Except now I need to digest whatever it was that just happened on that screen.

I mean, the film starts off with this insane montage of swirling dream sequences—I'm squinting already—like reality forgot to set an alarm and is still half asleep. There’s this character, an absolute whirlwind of a human, and at times I couldn’t decide if I wanted to hug them or tell them to slow the heck down. It was like watching a caffeinated squirrel trying to write a novel with its tail. How does one even describe that energy? Chaos wrapped in visceral emotion, maybe—or is that too “writerly”? Ugh, whatever.

> At one point, I couldn't help but laugh—I mean, it was probably one of those dramatic scenes where you're supposed to feel the weight of the world, but tell that to my twisted sense of humor. It's like my brain was doing somersaults just to keep up. And those soundtracks! My ears might still be vibrating, even as I sip my after-movie espresso, trying to calm down the adrenaline-obsessed orchestra in my head.

Then there was this weird subplot about searching for something or someone—it got almost philosophical. Heads were turning, hearts were breaking, and I was just there, caught between wanting to download the movie and dissect every detail or maybe just move on like a bump on the metaphoric log. Did they intend for it to be that layered, or is my tired brain just seeing things that aren't there?

So do I recommend you watch Thudarum? Uh—maybe? If you’re looking to let reality vaporize and morph into some kind of kaleidoscopic emotional rollercoaster, sure. But if you’re tired like I was, make sure you’ve chugged a double shot of something strong. Or don’t, and let yourself be confused like the rest of us.
